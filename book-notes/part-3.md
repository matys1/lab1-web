## LESSON 9

- Four core CSS properties:
  - `margin` and `padding` - adding space around elements
  - `align` and `float` - placing elements in relationship to others

### Margin

- `margin` adds space outside the element. You can specify margin for each side individually using `margin-top/right/bottom/left` properties or by using the `margin` shorthand property.

- If you use the shorthand `margin` property, you can list the size for each margin like this `margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;` (where the order of evaluation is clockwise: top, right, bottom, left).
  - If you specify just one value, for example `margin: 15px`, it applies the size to all four margins.
  - If you specify two values, the first value is for top and bottom and the second is for left and right margins.
  - If you specify three values, the first is for top, the second is for left and right and the third is for bottom.

- `margin` is calculated based on the containing element. You have to be especially mindful if you specify it in percentages.  
  > For example, if you set the `margin-left` property of an element within the body to 25%, the left margin of the element will end up being 25% of the width of the entire page. If you then set the `margin-left` property of an element within that element to 25% as well, it will be 25% of whatever that original 25% was calculated to be.

- The `<body>` element by default will have a margin (8px). This will cause elements to not be flush with the browser window even if you've specified no margin around those elements. To avoid this you have to specify the below in your style sheet.

```css
body {
  margin: 0px;
}
```

- If you have two bordered elements stacked on top (or along side) each other with no margin between them, there will be an appearance of a double border, which might not be desirable in many situations. To correct this, you have to make the borders of the sides of the elements that touch to be half the width so they appear to have the same width as all the other sides.

- If you have two elements stacked on top (or along side) each other with 30px `margin` all around them, then the gap between the elements will not be 60px but 30px as `margin` collapses automatically to the widest specified margin. This also means that if you specify the `margin` of the top element to be 40px and the `margin` of the bottom element to be 30px then the resulting gap will be 40px.

- The border, similar to `margin`, adds space outside the element. Which means that if you have an element that's 100px wide, and you have a 10px border all around it, the actual width of the element is 120px.
  - This means that, if you wanted the element below it to start where the first one ends, you would need to define a `margin-left: 120px` for the second element.
  - If the first element also has a 10px `margin` all around it, then you would need to define a `margin-left: 130px` for the second element for it to start where the first one ends.

### Padding

- `padding` adds space inside the element. Just like with `margin`, you can specify padding for each side individually using `padding-top/right/bottom/left` properties or by using the `padding` shorthand property.

- And just like with `margin`, if you use the shorthand `padding` property, you can list the size for each padding like this `padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px;` (where the order of evaluation is clockwise: top, right, bottom, left).
  - If you specify just one value, for example `padding: 15px`, it applies the size to all four sides.
  - If you specify two values, the first value is for top and bottom and the second is for left and right sides.
  - If you specify three values, the first is for top, the second is for left and right and the third is for bottom side.

- Because the padding of an element appears within the elementâ€™s content area, it assumes the same style as the content of the element, including the background color.

- If you have an element with a width of 50px and height of 30px and you set a 5px `padding` all around it then the content area will remain 50px wide and 30px high but the entire element will now take up 60px in width and 40px in height. If there are any borders defined, they will add to the total rendered width and height as well. In essence, `padding` stretches the footprint of the element outwards leaving the content area intact.

- If you look at the examples from margins.html you'll notice there's always a little bit of space between, for example, DIV #1 text and the top border. That space is not padding, because if you highlight the text you'll see that the area of the highlight is flush with the top border of the element. This shows that there is 0 padding defined from the top and that little bit of space is around the text itself.

- In the padding.html I wrapped the DIV #1/2/3/4 text in `<span>` tags and made the background white. This way you can see exactly how the padding affects the space between the text and the border. You can also wrap it in `<p>` tag but "by default, most browsers place a line break and a blank line between paragraphs" thus creating an artificial space between the text and border that's not defined by padding.

- To center an image or a block of content in your design, the easiest way is to change the horizontal (left and right) margins to `auto`, like `margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;` or use the margin shorthand `margin: 0 auto;`. This works only on elements that have a width set and that width is smaller than the current container.

- Elements only float horizontally not vertically, thus`float` property has only two possible values `left` and `right`. You can float all sorts of elements in the layout not just images.

- Play around with the float.html a bit more to understand `float` better. In essence, when you assign a `float: left` to an element, that element will float left and in doing so will overlap with existing elements if they are not floating as well (or stack side by side one another if they are both floating). Either way it will free up space for text to wrap around from the right.

- To control floating you can use the `clear` property with possible values `left`, `right`, `both`, `none` or `inherit`. For example, specifying `clear:left;` in an element ensures that no other floating elements are allowed to the left of it.

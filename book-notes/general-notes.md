## WordPress

WordPress is two things: **wordpress.com** and **wordpress.org**. 
- The former is an open-source and free Content Management System (CMS). As a CMS it's the most popular and used in the world with a larger marketshare than the rest of the competition combined.
- The latter is kind of like the business unit of WordPress where the same organization can make money off WordPress. It's a web hosting provider for wordpress-based websites.

In a nutshell, the key difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org is who’s actually hosting your website. With WordPress.org, you host your own site (self-hosting), using any web hosting provider, for example, like Bluehost. You’ll purchase your own web hosting service and then you’ll install the WordPress software from WordPress.org on that hosting. With WordPress.com, on the other hand, it’s WordPress.com that takes care of all of this for you so you don't need to look for a separate web hosting provider. You just register for an account and you can start building.

The overall consensus seems to be that the best and most flexible approach is to always pick your own web hosting provider and to install WordPress on it. A lot of 3rd party hosting providers offer integrated WordPress installers and even special plans optimized for WordPress sites. When you search for "best web hosting providers" you never see WordPress.com on any of the lists which further suggests that self-hosting is the best path and that the offering from WordPress.com leaves a lot to be desired.

## Content Management Systems (CMS)

CMS is a software application that allows users to build and manage a website without having to code it from scratch, or know how to code at all.

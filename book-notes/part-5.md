## LESSON 19:

- In web development, two types of scripting exist: server side and client side. Popular server-side scripting languages include: Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby. The book focuses on JavaScript for client-side scripting.

- JavaScript code can live in two places:
  - In its own file with a .js extension
  - Directly in your HTML files

- Regardless of where your JavaScript lives, your browser learns of its existence through the use of the `<script></script>` tag pair.

- When you store your JavaScript in external files, it is referenced in this manner:

```html
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
```

- Placing the JS code in a separate file makes it reusable across different pages. The `<script></script>` tags are typically placed between the `<head></head>` tags.

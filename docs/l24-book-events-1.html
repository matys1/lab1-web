        alt="View from Steptoe Butte">Steptoe Butte is a quartzite
        island jutting out of the silty loess of the <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palouse">Palouse</a>
        hills in Whitman County, Washington. The rock that forms
        the butte is over 400 million years old, in contrast with
        the 15-7 million year old <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River">Columbia
        River</a> basalts that underlie the rest of the Palouse
        (such "islands" of ancient rock have come to be called
        buttes, a butte being defined as a small hill with a flat
        top, whose width at top does not exceed its height).

        A hotel built by Cashup Davis stood atop Steptoe Butte from
        1888 to 1908, burning down several years after it closed.
        In 1946, Virgil McCroskey donated 120 acres (0.49 km2) of
        land to form Steptoe Butte State Park, which was later
        increased to over 150 acres (0.61 km2). Steptoe Butte is
        currently recognized as a National Natural Landmark because
        of its unique geological value. It is named in honor of <a
